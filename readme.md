REKAP
=====

Purpose : a silly but somehow convenient program that you activate at the beginning of your week to get:

- the latest 5 tweets your 5 favourite Twitter accounts issued
- the weather forecast for the next 5 days
- a recap of a selection of stock
etc.

Also to be considered :
- Unread email
- Latest news clusters on Google News ?
- A nice, free music to discover

This is for training, so we have no reason to make this in Python2, and will write it it Python 3.
