REKAP
=====

Purpose: a silly but convenient program that you activate at the beginning of your week to get:

- the latest 5 tweets your 5 favourite Twitter accounts issued
- the weather forecast for the next 5 days
- a recap of a selection of stock
etc.

Also to be considered :
- Unread email
- Latest news clusters on Google News ?
- A nice, proprietary-right-free music to discover


Dependency:
- "requests" module. For MacOS users,
`sudo pip3 install requests`
should do the trick.
